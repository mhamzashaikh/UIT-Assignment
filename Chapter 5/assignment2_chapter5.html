     Aansu lake, Pakistan - The name "Ansoo" comes from its tear-like shape ( the Urdu word Ansoo means teardropp ). The lake also resembles a human eye with a central ice island resembling the iris and a ridge resembling an eyebrow, which becomes even more prominent when ice melts on the "eyebrow" during the summer.
